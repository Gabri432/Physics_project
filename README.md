## Physics_project
A simple physics project showing an inclined surface and a ball upon it.

## Description
- A ball is put on top of an inclined surface whose slope and friction are variable.
- The ball will fall along the inclined surface at different speeds depending on the slope and friction.

## Project Structure
### Files
- README.md
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js
- angle.js
- ball.js
- license (MIT)

### How to use it
Two input bars will allow to play with the project:
- the first regolates the static friction value;
- the second regolates the slope (in degrees).

### Tool used
- Pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Git.
- VSCode
